### Customer Segmentation

Customers have different needs and behaviours. 
By grouping together those that are similar, you can adapt your approach to suit those differences. 
You can do this by targeting the customers who provide maximum value, encouraging new habits in those who cost you and tailoring your service to the different ways people use it. 
This algorithm will take a list of your customers, and returns an overview of optimally defined segments, as well as a model object that can be used to classify new customers live or by batch.
